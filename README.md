<h2> About the Author </h2>

My name is Will Black, and I'm currently a senior student at Cedar High School. I'm inspired by creativity in games, drawings, and architecture, and enjoy drawing examples of each. I often read fiction and am especially interested in books featuring dragons, so long as they're good. I also enjoy solving several different types of Rubik's Cubes, as well as many other puzzles. My interest in programming began with games like Minecraft or Terraria, which helped me to gain an interest in game development. I'm also interested in Web Development, and I hope to explore a career in that field as well as Software Development. I took a course in Software Development in hopes of improving my programming abilities and knowledge concerning different types of code.
